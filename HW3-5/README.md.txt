# HW3 – Dynamic Control of 3-Wheel Omni Robot

## Description
This homework extends the kinematic model of a 3-wheel omni robot by
introducing wheel dynamics and control.

## Features
- Body-to-wheel and wheel-to-body kinematics
- Discrete-time wheel dynamics
- PI controller
- Sliding Mode Controller (SMC)
- Phase portrait plots (e vs e_dot)
- Sliding surface convergence

## Files
- HW3-5.slx : Simulink model
- PARAMETERS.m : robot and controller parameters
- Run_SMC.m : simulation + plotting script
